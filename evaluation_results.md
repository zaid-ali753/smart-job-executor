# Evaluation Results: How We Measure Our Job Executor

This document explains, in simple terms, how we check if our job executor is working well. We focus on five main things:

---

## 1. Correctness: Do jobs run in the right order?

- **What we do:**  
  We keep a record of when each job is added and when it actually runs. After running some jobs, we look at these records to see if the jobs ran in the order we expected (like first-in, first-out).
- **Why it matters:**  
  If jobs run out of order, important tasks might get delayed or skipped.

---

## 2. Performance: How fast is the system?

- **What we do:**  
  We measure how long it takes to add a job, start a job, and finish a job. We also look at how many jobs the system can handle at once.
- **Why it matters:**  
  If things are slow, users will notice delays. We want the system to be quick and responsive.

---

## 3. Resource Safety: Do we stay within safe limits?

- **What we do:**  
  We watch how many jobs are running at the same time and check if we ever go over our set limits (like only 5 jobs at once). We also keep an eye on computer resources like memory and CPU.
- **Why it matters:**  
  If we use too many resources, the system could crash or slow down everything else on the server.

---

## 4. Failure Handling: Do retries work when something fails?

- **What we do:**  
  If a job fails, we try it again (retry). We keep track of every failure and every retry, and check if jobs eventually succeed or keep failing.
- **Why it matters:**  
  Sometimes things go wrong. We want to make sure the system can recover and finish jobs, not just give up.

---

## 5. Observability: Can we see what’s happening?

- **What we do:**  
  We log every important event (like jobs starting, finishing, or failing) and make these logs easy to read. We also provide a special page (called a metrics endpoint) where you can see live stats about the system.
- **Why it matters:**  
  If something goes wrong, or if we want to know how the system is doing, we need to be able to see what’s happening inside.

## Summary Table

| What We Check      | How We Check It                | Why It’s Important         |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Correctness        | Compare job order in logs      | Prevents missed/delayed jobs |
| Performance        | Measure how long things take   | Keeps system fast          |
| Resource Safety    | Watch job count and resources  | Avoids crashes/slowdowns   |
| Failure Handling   | Track failures and retries     | Makes system reliable      |
| Observability      | Log events, show live stats    | Helps us monitor and fix   |

**In short:**  
We use simple checks and clear records to make sure our job executor is correct, fast, safe, reliable, and easy to monitor. This helps us catch problems early and keep everything running smoothly.
